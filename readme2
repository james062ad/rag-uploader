# 📤 RAG Uploader: Document Ingestion for Semantic Search

This tool lets users upload `.txt` and `.pdf` documents into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Documents are chunked, embedded using OpenAI, and stored in a vector database (Supabase + pgvector). Uploads are logged to Comet for traceability.

## 🧠 What This App Does

- 📄 Upload `.txt` or `.pdf` files via Streamlit UI
- 🔪 Automatically chunk documents into sections
- 🧠 Embed each chunk using OpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002)
- ☁️ Insert chunks + embeddings into Supabase (pgvector)
- 📊 Log upload activity to Comet (Opik)
- 📈 Show real-time progress bar
